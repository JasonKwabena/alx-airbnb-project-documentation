# User Stories Documentation

## Purpose
This directory contains agile user stories derived from the system's use case diagram. Stories follow the standard format:

As a [role]
I want to [action]
So that [benefit]


## Organization
- Core user journeys (guest/host/admin)
- Prioritized by MVP functionality
- Includes acceptance criteria

## How to Use
1. Reference for sprint planning
2. Basis for test case development
3. Alignment with use case diagram

Key benefits of this structure:

    Traceability: Directly maps to your use case diagram

    Testability: Clear acceptance criteria for QA

    Prioritization: Separates must-have (1-5) from nice-to-have (6+).
